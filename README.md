# Harbor Scanner Adapter for Aqua Enterprise

> **NOTE**: This adapter is only required if you want Harbor to use Aqua Enterprise for its image scanning feature.
> If your objective is to use Aqua Enterprise to provide its own analysis reports against images stored in Harbor,
> that can be achieved without deploying this adapter.

The Harbor Scanner Adapter for Aqua Enterprise is a service that translates the Harbor scanning API into `scannercli`
commands and allows Harbor to use Aqua Enterprise ad hoc scanning for providing vulnerability reports on images stored
in Harbor registry as part of its vulnerability scan feature.

The adapter service implements the [Pluggable Scanners API v1.0][harbor-pluggable-scanner-api] and communicates with
the Aqua API server to fulfil the contract required by Harbor scanning API. This contract is based on OS and application
vulnerabilities, which implies that Harbor scanning API and Harbor Portal are **only capable of handling and displaying
OS and application vulnerabilities**.

![HLD](docs/images/hld.png)

> **NOTE**: To see the whole report generated by the Aqua scanner, including detected malware and sensitive data,
> you have to navigate from Harbor Portal to Aqua Management Console. Similarly, Harbor does not have support for
> displaying or enforcing Aqua's image assurance policies. You will need to use the Aqua Management Console to view
> and configure these policies.

## Requirements

1. Harbor >= 1.10
2. This adapter service requires Aqua Enterprise >= 4.5 deployment to operate. The adapter can be deployed before the
   Aqua Enterprise installation, but the Aqua Management Console URL and credentials must be known to configure the
   adapter with the [environment variables](#configuration).
3. The adapter service also requires the `scannercli` executable binary, in version matching the Aqua Enterprise, to be
   mounted at `/usr/local/bin/scannercli`. The provided Helm chart mounts the `scannercli` executable automatically by
   pulling the `registry.aquasec.com/scanner:$AQUA_VERSION` image from Aqua Registry and running it as an
   [init container][k8s-init-containers]. The init container's command is configured to copy the executable from the
   container's filesystem to an [emptyDir][k8s-volume-emptyDir] volume, which is shared with the main container. This
   makes the `scannercli` executable available to the main container at `/usr/local/bin/scannercli`.

   > **NOTE**: Make sure that you provide valid Aqua Registry credentials received from Aqua Security as Helm values
   > in order to create the corresponding image pull secret.

   If you're not using Kubernetes to run the adapter service, you have to download the `scannercli` executable from the
   Aqua downloads page manually and mount it at `/usr/local/bin/scannercli`.
   See [Aqua Scanner Executable Binary][aqua-docs-scanner-binary] for more details on manual download.
4. It is highly recommended to create a new user in the Aqua Management Console with credentials dedicated to the
   Harbor adapter, e.g. `harbor_scanner`. The adapter does not need full access to Aqua: the `Scanner` role is the only
   permission required for the `scannercli` executable binary which is run by the adapter service on each scan request.
   Therefore, create your `harbor_scanner` user and assign it only the `Scanner` role.

   ![](docs/images/aqua_user_for_harbor.png)
5. It is also highly recommended to create a new user in Harbor for the Aqua Enterprise scanner, with permission only to
   pull images from Harbor, e.g. `aqua_scanner`. Please remember to add this user as a member of the project in Harbor
   that you intend to scan the images from.

   ![](docs/images/harbor_user_for_aqua.png)
6. Finally, add a new Harbor registry integration in Aqua Management Console and use the credentials of the user
   created in the previous step. Please note that the value of the **Registry Name** field corresponds to the
   `SCANNER_AQUA_REGISTRY` [configuration](#configuration) variable.

   ![](docs/images/adding_harbor_registry_in_aqua.png)

## How does it work?

In essence, a scan request payload sent by Harbor to the adapter:

```json
{
  "registry": {
    "url": "https://core.harbor.domain",
    "authorization": "Basic BASE64_ENCODED_CREDENTIALS"
  },
  "artifact": {
    "repository": "library/mongo",
    "tag": "3.4-xenial",
    "digest": "sha256:6c3c624b58dbbcd3c0dd82b4c53f04194d1247c6eebdaab7c610cf7d66709b3b",
    "mime_type": "application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json"
  }
}
```

is translated to the following `scannercli` command:

```
$ scannercli scan \
    --checkonly \
    --dockerless \
    --user=$SCANNER_AQUA_USERNAME \
    --password=$SCANNER_AQUA_PASSWORD \
    --host=$SCANNER_AQUA_HOST \
    --registry=$SCANNER_AQUA_REGISTRY \
    --robot-username=$HARBOR_ROBOT_ACCOUNT_NAME \
    --robot-password=$HARBOR_ROBOT_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD \
    --no-verify=$SCANNER_CLI_NO_VERIFY \
    --show-negligible=$SCANNER_CLI_SHOW_NEGLIGIBLE \
    --jsonfile /var/lib/scanner/reports/aqua_scan_report_0123456789.json \
    library/mongo@sha256:6c3c624b58dbbcd3c0dd82b4c53f04194d1247c6eebdaab7c610cf7d66709b3b
```

Finally, the output report is transformed to Harbor's model and displayed in the Harbor interface.

> **NOTE:** The `SCANNER_AQUA_USE_IMAGE_TAG` env determines whether the image tag (`library/mongo:3.4-xenial`)
> or digest (`library/mongo@sha256:6c3c624b58dbbcd3c0dd82b4c53f04194d1247c6eebdaab7c610cf7d66709b3b`) is used as
> the image identifier passed to the `scannercli` command.

> **NOTE:** Harbor versions >= 2.0 no longer set the `tag` property in the scan request and therefore the value of
> the `SCANNER_AQUA_USE_IMAGE_TAG` env must be set to `false`.

## Deployment

Harbor can be [installed as a Docker service][harbor-docs-installer] or deployed with [high availability via Helm][harbor-docs-helm].
This section describes how to perform a new installation of the adapter service in both cases.

It's also possible to deploy Harbor on Docker (outside the Kubernetes environment) to work with Aqua Enterprise on
Kubernetes, and you should be able to figure it out based on the following instructions.

### Docker

This section shows how to install the adapter service by [extending the Docker Compose file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/)
created by the Harbor >= 1.10 installer in the `$HARBOR_HOME` directory. We assume that the internal
[TLS communication between Harbor components][harbor-docs-internal-tls] is enabled and internal certificate files are
stored in the `$HARBOR_PKI_DIR` directory. The default Harbor data volume path is referred to as `$HARBOR_DATA`. We also
assume that you installed Aqua Enterprise >= 4.5, and the Aqua Management Console is accessible at
https://aqua-console:8443, and you have valid credentials with permission to scan container images.

1. Export environment variables that are used throughout the installation scripts.

   Review and adapt the values to reflect your installation paths and credentials.
   ```
   export HARBOR_HOME="/opt/harbor"
   export HARBOR_DATA="/data"
   export HARBOR_PKI_DIR="/etc/harbor/pki/internal"

   export AQUA_VERSION="6.2"
   export AQUA_CONSOLE_HOST="https://aqua-console:8443"
   export AQUA_CONSOLE_USERNAME=<your username>
   export AQUA_CONSOLE_PASSWORD=<your password>

   export HARBOR_SCANNER_AQUA_VERSION="0.12.0"
   ```
   ```
   export AQUA_REGISTRY_USERNAME=<your username>
   export AQUA_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=<your password>
   ```
2. Create the config and data directories for the adapter service.
   ```
   mkdir -p $HARBOR_HOME/common/config/aqua-adapter
   mkdir -p $HARBOR_DATA/aqua-adapter/reports
   mkdir -p $HARBOR_DATA/aqua-adapter/opt
   ```
3. Download the `scannercli` executable binary.
   1. You can download the binary from the [docs][download-scannercli] page and save it to
      `$HARBOR_HOME/common/config/aqua-adapter/scannercli`.
   2. Alternatively you can use the `registry.aquasec.com/scanner:$AQUA_VERSION` image to copy the `scannercli` binary
      from the container's file system.
      ```
      echo $AQUA_REGISTRY_PASSWORD | docker login registry.aquasec.com \
        --username $AQUA_REGISTRY_USERNAME --password-stdin
      ```
      ```
      docker run --rm --entrypoint "" \
        --volume $HARBOR_HOME/common/config/aqua-adapter:/out registry.aquasec.com/scanner:$AQUA_VERSION \
        cp /opt/aquasec/scannercli /out
      ```
4. Generate certificate files.
   > **NOTE**: Self signed certificates without SAN were deprecated in Go, therefore you must add the SAN
   > extension to your certificate files. The DNS name in SAN extension should be the same as CN field.
   1. Generate a private key.
      ```
      openssl genrsa -out $HARBOR_PKI_DIR/aqua_adapter.key 4096
      ```
   2. Generate a certificate signing request (CSR).

      Adapt the values in the `-subj` option to reflect your organization.
      ```
      openssl req -sha512 -new \
        -subj "/C=CN/ST=Beijing/L=Beijing/O=example/OU=Personal/CN=aqua-adapter" \
        -key $HARBOR_PKI_DIR/aqua_adapter.key \
        -out $HARBOR_PKI_DIR/aqua_adapter.csr
      ```
   3. Generate an x509 v3 extension file.

      You must create this file so that you can generate a certificate for adapter service host that complies with the
      Subject Alternative Name (SAN) and x509 v3 extension requirements.
      ```
      cat << EOF > $HARBOR_PKI_DIR/aqua_adapter_v3.ext
      authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer
      basicConstraints=CA:FALSE
      keyUsage = digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment
      extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth
      subjectAltName = @alt_names

      [alt_names]
      DNS.1=aqua-adapter
      EOF
      ```
   4. Use the `aqua_adapter_v3.ext` file to generate a certificate for adapter service host.
      > **NOTE**: The certificate must be signed by the internal Harbor CA.
      ```
      openssl x509 -req -sha512 -days 365 \
        -extfile $HARBOR_PKI_DIR/aqua_adapter_v3.ext \
        -CA $HARBOR_PKI_DIR/harbor_internal_ca.crt \
        -CAkey $HARBOR_PKI_DIR/harbor_internal_ca.key \
        -CAcreateserial \
        -in $HARBOR_PKI_DIR/aqua_adapter.csr \
        -out $HARBOR_PKI_DIR/aqua_adapter.crt
      ```
5. Create the `env` file to configure the adapter service:
   ```
   cat << EOF > $HARBOR_HOME/common/config/aqua-adapter/env
   SCANNER_LOG_LEVEL=info
   SCANNER_API_ADDR=:8443
   SCANNER_API_TLS_KEY=/etc/pki/aqua_adapter.key
   SCANNER_API_TLS_CERTIFICATE=/etc/pki/aqua_adapter.crt
   SCANNER_AQUA_HOST=$AQUA_CONSOLE_HOST
   SCANNER_AQUA_USERNAME=$AQUA_CONSOLE_USERNAME
   SCANNER_AQUA_PASSWORD=$AQUA_CONSOLE_PASSWORD
   SCANNER_AQUA_REGISTRY=Harbor
   SCANNER_AQUA_USE_IMAGE_TAG=false
   SCANNER_AQUA_REPORTS_DIR=/var/lib/scanner/reports
   SCANNER_STORE_REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
   EOF
   ```
6. Create `docker-compose.override.yml` file in the `$HARBOR_HOME` directory to install the adapter service:
   ```
   cat << EOF > $HARBOR_HOME/docker-compose.override.yml
   version: '2.3'
   services:
     aqua-adapter:
       networks:
         - harbor
       container_name: aqua-adapter
       image: docker.io/aquasec/harbor-scanner-aqua:$HARBOR_SCANNER_AQUA_VERSION
       restart: always
       cap_drop:
         - ALL
       depends_on:
         - redis
       env_file:
         $HARBOR_HOME/common/config/aqua-adapter/env
       volumes:
         - type: bind
           source: $HARBOR_HOME/common/config/aqua-adapter/scannercli
           target: /usr/local/bin/scannercli
         - type: bind
           source: $HARBOR_PKI_DIR/aqua_adapter.key
           target: /etc/pki/aqua_adapter.key
         - type: bind
           source: $HARBOR_PKI_DIR/aqua_adapter.crt
           target: /etc/pki/aqua_adapter.crt
         - type: bind
           source: $HARBOR_DATA/aqua-adapter/reports
           target: /var/lib/scanner/reports
         - type: bind
           source: $HARBOR_DATA/aqua-adapter/opt
           target: /opt/aquascans
       logging:
         driver: "syslog"
         options:
           syslog-address: "tcp://127.0.0.1:1514"
           tag: "aqua-scanner"
   EOF
   ```
7. For some Docker drivers you must explicitly set ownership of config files and data directories to user and
   group which runs the adapter process, i.e. `1000:1000`:
   ```
   chown 1000:1000 $HARBOR_HOME/common/config/aqua-adapter/scannercli
   chown 1000:1000 $HARBOR_PKI_DIR/aqua_adapter.key
   chown 1000:1000 $HARBOR_PKI_DIR/aqua_adapter.crt
   chown 1000:1000 $HARBOR_DATA/aqua-adapter/reports
   chown 1000:1000 $HARBOR_DATA/aqua-adapter/opt
   ```
8. Start the adapter service:
   ```
   cd $HARBOR_HOME
   docker-compose up --detach
   ```
   The adapter service will be accessible at https://aqua-adapter:8443 from within the `harbor` Docker network.
9. [Connect Harbor to Aqua scanner.](#configuring-harbor-scanner)

### Kubernetes

> I assume that you installed Aqua Enterprise >= 4.5 with [Aqua Security Helm charts][aqua-helm-chart] in the `aqua`
> namespace, and the Aqua Management Console is accessible at http://aqua-console-svc.aqua:8080 from within the cluster.

1. Export environment variables that are used throughout the installation scripts.

   Review and adapt the values to reflect your installation paths and credentials.
   ```
   export AQUA_VERSION="6.2"
   export AQUA_CONSOLE_HOST="http://aqua-console-svc.aqua:8080"
   export AQUA_CONSOLE_USERNAME=<your username>
   export AQUA_CONSOLE_PASSWORD=<your password>

   export AQUA_REGISTRY_USERNAME=<your username>
   export AQUA_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=<your password>
   ```
2. Install the `harbor-scanner-aqua` chart:
   ```
   helm repo add aqua https://aquasecurity.github.io/helm-charts/
   helm repo update
   ```
   ```
   helm install harbor-scanner-aqua aqua/harbor-scanner-aqua \
     --namespace harbor \
     --set aqua.version=$AQUA_VERSION \
     --set aqua.registry.server=registry.aquasec.com \
     --set aqua.registry.username=$AQUA_REGISTRY_USERNAME \
     --set aqua.registry.password=$AQUA_REGISTRY_PASSWORD \
     --set scanner.aqua.host=$AQUA_CONSOLE_HOST \
     --set scanner.aqua.username=$AQUA_CONSOLE_USERNAME \
     --set scanner.aqua.password=$AQUA_CONSOLE_PASSWORD
   ```
   The scanner service should be accessible at http://harbor-scanner-aqua.harbor:8080 from within the cluster.
3. [Connect Harbor to Aqua scanner.](#configuring-harbor-scanner)

### OpenShift Container Platform

Similar to the way that RBAC resources control user access, administrators can use Security Context Constraints (SCCs)
to control permissions for pods. These permissions include actions that a pod can perform and what resources it can
access. You can use SCCs to define a set of conditions that a pod must run with in order to be accepted into the system.

In particular, SCCs allow an administrator to control:
* The container user ID
* The allocation of an fsGroup that owns the pod's volumes

The harbor-scanner-aqua’s Helm chart deployment template:
* Runs the underlying pod with a dedicated service account (named after a Helm release)
* Requires that the pod's containers run as user with ID `1000`
* Requires that fsGroup that owns the pod's volumes has ID `1000`

Therefore, the harbor-scanner-aqua deployment will be accepted by OpenShift Container Platform only when a service
account is granted access to a SCC that:
* Allows container user with ID `1000`
* Allows fsGroup with ID `1000`

For example, if the scanner adapter installed as the Helm release called `harbor-scanner-aqua` in the `harbor` namespace,
the following command has to be run by the administrator to accept the pods:

```
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user <scc name> system:serviceaccount:harbor:harbor-scanner-aqua
```

where `<scc name>` is one of the predefined SCCs or a custom SCC created by the administrator.

### Configuring Harbor Scanner

1. Log in to the Harbor interface with an account that has Harbor system administrator privileges.
2. Expand **Administration**, and select **Interrogation Services**.
   ![Scanners config](docs/images/harbor_ui_scanners_config.png)
3. Click the **NEW SCANNER** button.
4. Enter the information to identify the scanner.
   1. A unique name for this scanner instance to display in the Harbor interface, e.g. **Aqua Enterprise 6.2**.
   2. The API endpoint URL of the adapter service.

      > **NOTE**: For the adapter deployed on Kubernetes the default URL is http://harbor-scanner-aqua.harbor:8080,
      > whereas for Docker, it's https://aqua-adapter:8443.

   ![Add scanner](docs/images/harbor_ui_add_scanner.png)
5. Click **TEST CONNECTION** to make sure that Harbor can connect successfully to the adapter service.

   > **NOTE**: When you click the **TEST CONNECTION** button Harbor only pings the adapter service. It does not validate
   > connection to the Aqua Management Console, which is configured with `SCANNER_AQUA_USERNAME`, `SCANNER_AQUA_PASSWORD`,
   > and `SCANNER_AQUA_HOST` environment variables. If the connection to the Aqua Management Console is misconfigured
   > you will see an error message in the scan logs accessible from the Harbor interface.
6. If everything is fine click **ADD** to save the configuration and connect Harbor to the adapter service.
7. If you configured multiple scanners, you can designate the Aqua Enterprise scanner as the default one by selecting it
   and clicking **SET AS DEFAULT**.
   ![Set default scanner](docs/images/harbor_ui_default_scanner.png)
   Make sure the **Default** label is displayed next to the Aqua scanner's name.

## Configuration

Configuration of the adapter is done via environment variables at startup.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: Failed getting image manifest: 412 Precondition Failed

Currently, there's a limitation of `scannercli` in Aqua Enterprise versions < **4.6.20181 (4.6 update 16)** which do not
accept Harbor robot account credentials passed by a Harbor scan job to the adapter service. This effectively means that
the Aqua Enterprise scanner is using the credentials provided in Aqua Management Console under the
**Integrations** / **Image Registries** section. However, these credentials do not have enough permissions to bypass the
deployment security checker when it's enabled in the Harbor project configuration. In other words, the deployment
security checker prevents the Aqua Enterprise scanner from pulling an image, which it needs to be able to do in order
to scan it.

![](docs/images/harbor_deployment_security.png)

The available solution depends on the version of your Aqua Enterprise deployment. In `scannercli` version >= **4.6.20181 (4.6 update 16)**
we've introduced new `--robot-username` and `--robot-password` flags to respect credentials provided by Harbor.

- For Aqua Enterprise version < **4.6.20181 (4.6 update 16)** you can only disable deployment security checks in the Harbor
  interface under the project configuration.
- For Aqua Enterprise version >= **4.6.20181 (4.6 update 16)** set the value of the `SCANNER_CLI_OVERRIDE_REGISTRY_CREDENTIALS`
  env to `true`.

### Error: Failed scanning image: image was not found in registry

For Harbor versions >= 2.0, which do not set the `tag` property in a scan request anymore, the value of the
`SCANNER_AQUA_USE_IMAGE_TAG` env must be set to `false`. This informs the adapter service to use digest rather than tag
as the image identifier.

### Error: Failed scanning image: no such registry

Make sure the value of the `SCANNER_AQUA_REGISTRY` env is the same as the **Registry Name** entered in Aqua Management
Console.

### Scans are not displayed in the CI/CD Scans page

Normally, scans performed via the `scannercli` scan command (not through the daemon mode) are only saved if the images
are also registered in Aqua Enterprise. To store and display all `scannercli` scans in the **CI/CD Scans** page,
accessible from within the **Images** page, enable the **Save CI/CD scans** option in the Aqua Management Console.

Now, even if the images stored in Harbor were not registered in Aqua Enterprise, you'd see them in the **CI/CD Scans** page.
